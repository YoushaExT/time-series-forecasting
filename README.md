# Requirements

In the assignment, select two datasets of time series from ML repository. One of them must have only (time+kpi) data and the other must have (time+kpi+other variables) data.

On both, apply TSF with Exponential Smoothing, AR, MA, ARIMA, and SARIMA. Compare and contrast thoroughly each model to get the marks. As output, I want to see model fitted on whole training data as well as on the test data. Also forecast, several time steps into the future for each data.

Remember to difference if required.
